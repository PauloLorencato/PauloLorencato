My previous knowledge so far includes:

	Algorithms;	
 	Basic data structures (quewes, stacks, chain lists, trees and hashtables);	
 	Back-end development:		
  		C# with .NET (beginner);
    		Javascript with NodeJS (beginner);

I'm currently aiming at expanding my knowledge on back-end, as well as honing my skills on web development as a whole. In this profile, you may find examples of exercises, as well as complete projects as I go through my learning process. Feel free to suggest any contents here, also open for advices and requests.
